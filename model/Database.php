      //it is better for blobs of code like this instead of writing a lot of code and it is easier 
      //to call and when you call it it runs faster and slimpler for the user to use and you can use over and over 
      //instead of writing it like 10 times 
      //when you call it again it makes a new instance of a consistant object 
      //makes it a global varible so we can access then whenver
      //you want to
